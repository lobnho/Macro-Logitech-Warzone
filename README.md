import the lobinho_scriptEN.lua in your GHUB, or copy the code and paste it

if you don't know how to do this, watch a video on youtube (it's easy)

put your ping keybind on the left Alt

the code basically consists of no recoil and auto tag, there are explanatory notes in case you want to use it, but it's ready, just aim and shoot.
